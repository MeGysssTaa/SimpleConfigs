# SimpleConfigs
#### An extremely simple and lightweight configs API for Java

Working on a kind of a small or simple project and looking for a simple and lightweight library that will enable you to store specific settings in configuration files with ability to then read those easily? **SimpleConfigs** is probably what you need.

**Features:**
    * Write and edit configuration files both programmatically and manually;
    * Read configuration files in a map with just 1 line of code;
    * Modify values of existing settings and add new ones easily;
    * Obtain settings casted to the types you need;
    * Configuration comments;
    * Very lightweight and easy to use.
    
**Drawbacks** (some are probably temporary and will be solved in the near future):
    * Key-value split char space dependence (`=` != ` = `);
    * No strict entries order after saving programmatically;
    * Comments get removed after saving programmatically.
