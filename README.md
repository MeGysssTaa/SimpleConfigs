# SimpleConfigs
## An extremely simple and lightweight configs API for Java

Working on a kind of a small or simple project and looking for a simple and lightweight library that will enable you to store specific settings in configuration files with ability to then read those easily? **SimpleConfigs** is probably what you need.

**Features:**
* Write and edit configuration files both programmatically and manually;
* Read configuration files in a map with just 1 line of code;
* Modify values of existing settings and add new ones easily;
* Obtain settings casted to the types you need;
* Configuration comments;
* Very lightweight and easy to use.
    
**Drawbacks** (some are probably temporary and will be solved in the near future):
* Key-value split char space dependence (`=` != ` = `);
* Comments get removed after saving programmatically.
